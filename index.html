      <h3>Membership Details</h3>
      <div class="membership">
        <h4>What members receive</h4>
        <p>
          Membership in Trenches Base grants participants a measured, transparent share of all platform fees collected by the Base. Members receive regular distributions of fees ("fees shares") proportionate to their purchased slot(s). Distributions are scheduled and recorded on an auditable ledger so every member can verify their entitlements.
        </p>

        <h4>Security & reliability</h4>
        <p>
          We operate with a conservative approach: fee pools are segregated, payouts originate from a dedicated distribution pipeline, and routine reconciliations are performed to ensure accuracy. Members are notified of each distribution with clear timestamps and summaries.
        </p>

        <h4>Governance & transparency</h4>
        <p>
          Members gain access to mission logs and governance summaries. Fee allocation rules, slot counts, and distribution mechanics are published to members so allocation is predictable and fair. Any change to allocation policy is announced in advance with rationale and vote outcomes where applicable.
        </p>

        <h4>Why join</h4>
        <p>
          Joining converts passive interest into an earned stream. Instead of relying on speculation, members earn a share of real platform revenue — recurring, measurable, and tied to usage. For serious participants seeking steady upside and visibility into operations, membership provides alignment and a clear economic stake.
        </p>

        <h4>Onboarding & support</h4>
        <p>
          New members receive a concise onboarding packet explaining slot mechanics, expected cadence of distributions, and support contacts. We offer direct channels for account help and distribution inquiries to keep operations smooth and professional.
